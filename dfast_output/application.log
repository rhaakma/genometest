2025/03/26 10:49:35 The query genome is treated as a draft genome with 520 sequences.
2025/03/26 10:49:35 Sequences are sorted by length (from longer to shorter).
2025/03/26 10:49:35 Sequences shorter than 200 will be eliminated.
2025/03/26 10:49:35 Sequences will be renamed as sequence001, sequence002...
2025/03/26 10:49:35 Locus_tag settings: locus_tag_prefix=LOCUS and step=10.
2025/03/26 10:49:35 Locus_tags are assigned separately to each feature type. e.g. CDS: LOCUS_000xx, rRNA: LOCUS_r000xx, tRNA: LOCUS_t000xx, tmRNA: LOCUS_tm000xx.
2025/03/26 10:49:35 Remove_Partial_Feature is enabled.
